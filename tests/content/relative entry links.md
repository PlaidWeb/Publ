Some links to entries on a relative basis

.....

How about the [image test](images/image renditions.md)?

Or maybe the [bullet number test](markdown-titles/bullet number.md)?

Does it work if it's in a [different category](differentcat.md)?

How about a [parent directory](../content/html-links.html)?

Or something [relative to root](/images/exif orientations.md)?

What about [by entry ID](325)?

And what if [nothing is found](asdlkfjsalfj)?

Of course [external links should still work](http://beesbuzz.biz/), even if they're [protocol-relative](//beesbuzz.biz).

So should [internal absolute links](/images/).
