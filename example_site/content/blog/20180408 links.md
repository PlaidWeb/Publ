[Claude](http://notimetoplay.org) let me know about an [article on Wired about RSS's comeback](https://www.wired.com/story/rss-readers-feedly-inoreader-old-reader/). For those who don't want to self-host their
own [Feed on Feeds instance](http://github.com/fluffy-critter/Feed-On-Feeds) there are some pretty good
recommendations for readers to use there.

They also point to Dave Winer's [feedbase.io](http://feedbase.io/), where you can submit
your feed reader's OPML export and see what stuff other folks are subscribing to as well. In case you want
to start discovering some more feeds!

.....

On a related note, I've been thinking about means of adding discovery/recommendations to things.
Having the ability to link to a [FOAF](http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/) or [OPML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML)
from your own feed, and then having readers parse it to aggregate these as recommendations, would be pretty cool.
And that FOAF or OPML could just be something that's generated by your own feed reader; maybe it's something
I could add to Feed on Feeds at some point, for example.

(Oh, and as soon as I have a tool for republishing an Atom or RSS feed from another source, that means that
FeedOnFeeds' sharing function immediately becomes useful for content republishing as well.)

On the Publ front, I did [some more refactoring](https://github.com/fluffy-critter/Publ/issues/31) today,
and I plan to do no other Publ programming. Because it's still the weekend, darn it! (Also I have other
projects I need to be working on right now.)
