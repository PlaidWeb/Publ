Well, I've been pretty busy working away on Publ. Right now I'm just focusing
on the stuff necessary to make for an okay blog, with more content types to come
later. Fortunately everything stacks on top of everything else!

Here's some highlights of what I've done so far.

.....

* Opened [a bunch of issues for things to do](http://github.com/fluffy-critter/Publ/issues)
* Fleshed out the [template API](/template-format)
* Added newest-first sorting and entry limits to the `View` API
* Beautified some of the page templates and stylesheets
* Fixed some annoying bugs around entry editing and deletion (including a nasty race condition in the content indexer!)
* Improved the Atom template
    * now [it validates](http://www.feedvalidator.org/check.cgi?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpubl.beesbuzz.biz)!
    * also it uses a `<![[CDATA]]>` block  for the entry itself, which makes everything get escaped properly
* Fixed the site content-types to show the correct ones (including UTF-8 for HTML output)
* Lots and lots of documentation cleanup
* Also made `Entry-Type` way more general and useful, and actually implemented it into views
