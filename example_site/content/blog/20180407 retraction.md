I ended up refactoring the query generator and a lot of template stuff. It feels good to have my codebase approaching sensibility on a lot of stuff. Even if my wrists don't feel so good.

Anyway I'm posting this from my iPad in bed just to prove that 
it's possible. Although not recommended; vi is kind of hard to use this way.

(this is why i really hope someone steps up and makes some sort of web-based site editing tool for Publ. 
i just might do it myself after i get Publ itself in a state where it feels done-ish.)

ok bedtime now zzzzzzz esc :wq
