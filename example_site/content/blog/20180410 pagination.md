Something you might notice on [this very blog](/blog/) is that now there are only
5 entries shown at a time by default, and there are handy links for the previous
and next page.

Another useful thing: [browsing by date](/blog/?date=2018-04-10), which also
works on [months](/blog/?date=2018-04) and [years](/blog/?date=2018).

There's still a bit of stuff that should be added but this was the second-to-last
major thing to do before considering Publ useful enough for me to start migrating
my own site over.
